title: Jesus said "I am ..."
author: Andrea

During the summer we met for a six week series on the "I am" statements
found in the book of John. Each week Andrea led us in a discussion of
the week's passage.

1. I am *the bread of life*: {%bible John 6:35%}
2. I am *the light of the world*: {%bible John 8:12%} & {%bible John 9:5%}
3. I am *the good shepherd*: {%bible John 10:7%} & {%bible John 10:14%}
4. I am *the resurrection and the life*: {%bible John 11:25%}
5. I am *the way, the truth, and the life*: {%bible John 14:6%}
6. I am *the true vine*: {%bible John 15:1%}

We talked about the radical statements Jesus made and the themes that
ran throughout them including all life comes from Jesus and it is
through Jesus that we can live the fullest life and one day get to
heaven.

We also took time to pray for one another and enjoy summer in the park.
