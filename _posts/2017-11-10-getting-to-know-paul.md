title: Getting to know Paul
author: Si√¥n

Over the past few months we've been following a series of Bible chapters from the book of Acts, related to the life of Paul and how he turned, from a powerful persecutor of Christians, to a brave missionary and the apostle whose letters make up most of the new testament.

The chapters we read were:

1. {%bible Acts 9%}: His dramatic conversion
2. {%bible Acts 13%}: His first missionary journey
3. {%bible Acts 14%}: Mission accomplished
4. {%bible Acts 16%}: Jailbreak in Philippi
5. {%bible Acts 26%}: Witnessing to a king
6. {%bible Acts 27%}: Shipwrecked
7. {%bible Acts 28%}: Mission in Rome

After reading through each chapter we tried imagining what it must have felt like to witness it first-hand, as it happened at the time, and tried to bring relevant parts into a modern context we could relate to directly.  This usually lead to sharing and some interesting discussions.
