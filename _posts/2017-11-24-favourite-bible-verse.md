title: Favourite bible verse
author: Berni

Everyone was asked to bring his/her favourite bible verse and I brought papers and pens so there could be a "creative" time, where everyone makes a card with it, after that we shared it with each other (optional: why is this your fauvourite or if there is a story/testimony that is related to that...) and they could decide if they want to keep it for themselves or in the end we would pick a random one from a hat or give it to a friend or someone on the street...
