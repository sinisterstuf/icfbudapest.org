Saturday afternoon we gathered to venture to our friend, Arpi's family
house for a grill party :)

It was so relaxing sitting outside in their garden among nice roses,
much green and in fresh air.  We had time to share a bit about our lives
(eg. some fun facts about everyone :) and of course lots of good food
and chilling.

Since it was really nice weather we walked to a nearby lake and braved
the water, was so much fun.

Afterwards we returned to the house and continued with some sports,
first volleyball then Arpi taught us how to play foot-tennis :) Was a
refreshing Saturday afternoon. Thank you all for joining...
