This Sunday we hiked up [Kalvária Hegy][osmnode] in the Buda Hills.  As
the name suggests, it has three crosses at the peak, imitating the
Calvary Hill in Jerusalem, where Jesus died.

[osmnode]: https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3156588146

It also has 14 stops along the way, called *"Stations of the Cross"*,
marking different events of the passion and death of Jesus.  At each
station we stopped to read relevant Bible verses.  The Stations of the
Cross are based on biblical text and Roman Catholic tradition and you
can follow them in church during [the time of lent][lent].

These are the verses we read at each station:

1. **Jesus is condemned to death:** {%bible Mark 15:1-15%}, {%bible Matthew 27:23-31%}
1. **Jesus takes up the Cross:** {%bible John 19:13-17%}, {%bible John 19:5%}
