What is lent?
-------------

This Friday we talked about lent.

Lent is observed in some Christian denominations, for example the Roman
Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox church.  It involves self-denial,
fasting and confession during the 40 days leading up to Easter,
symbolising the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert.  Although
most Catholics abstain specifically from meat, people often choose to
deny some pleasurable activity and spend time in prayer instead.  A
modern example is abstaining from Facebook.

The word "lent" comes from an Old English word "lenten", meaning Spring.

What did we talk about?
-----------------------

We talked about fasting in general and different people's experience
with it.  We thought about what it's for and why we have lent before
Easter.  An interesting observation was that if you deny yourself
something, then during that time you can focus more on God instead.  In
this way fasting can be a good way to connect with the Lord.

We also drew similarities with the 40 days of fasting that Jesus did in
the desert.  We noted that during this time, Jesus was so focused on
fasting that it only mentions him being hungry *after* 40 days; until
that time he was concerning himself with spiritual nourishment, spending
time with the Father:

[Matthew 4:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4%3A1-11&version=NIV) (NIV)

> **2** After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.

Similarly, after talking to the Samaritan woman at the well, when asked
to eat, Jesus replies that his task on Earth is food enough:

[John 4:27-38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4%3A27-38&version=NIV) (NIV)

> **34** "My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.

Lastly, we had a look at what Jesus says about how you should fast:

[Matthew 6:16-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A16-18&version=NIV) (NIV)

> **16** "When you fast, do not look sombre as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting.  Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.  **17** But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, **18** so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

Basically, that the point is not to suffer publicly, or to suffer at
all, but rather to put things aside to spend more time with God and
build on that relationship.

I pray that we can all set aside some time to connect with God.
