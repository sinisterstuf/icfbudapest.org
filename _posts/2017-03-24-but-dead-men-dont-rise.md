title: But dead men don't rise...?

This Friday, instead of meeting at Forum, we attended the event "*Dead
men don't rise ...?*" at BME (the technical university). The lecture
was held by Peter Payne, PhD, Philosophy, University of California.

Here's a snippet of the lecture:

The resurrection of Jesus is at the heart of the Christian faith, so
whether it's true or not is a crucial question.

> "If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and
> your faith also is in vain."

{%bible 1 Corinthians 15:14%}

About miracles:

Even for natural events we infer that they have a natural cause, so when
is it reasonable to infer that a miracle has occurred?  For example,
someone walking on water, suppose there's no natural explanation.

Our options:

  * physics undergo radical changes → conflicts with science for a
    philosophical conjecture
  * maintain our beliefs about what is physically possible → a miracle
    took place → doesn't conflict

Some skeptic reasons:

> Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence

**False**: e.g. proton decay → we have never seen it, but it could
happen.

Extraordinary evidence is needed if:

  * there's good reason to think it could not happen
  * accepting the claim would have major consequences:
    * huge change in beliefs
    * high economic cost
  * science has shown many reports to be false
    * doesn't tell you anything about whether there can be true ones
    * higher bar of evidence to weed out the false from the
      potentially genuine


**Q:** How much evidence is needed to reasonably believe a miracle
report?

**A:** No formal inductive logic (equally informed, critical,
intelligent people can widely disagree).

Background beliefs are crucial:

  * serious problems with naturalism? (only the natural world is real)
  * evidence for the existence of God?
  * evidence for Christianity?
  * potential practical consequences of belief/disbelief?
  * "natural laws have to be without exception" → then miracles are
    impossible
  * materialism & naturalism: philosophical, not scientific
  * science can't tell what God is like
  * if miracles support the Christian faith, a lot comes with it e.g.
    the resurrection, which proves that Jesus was who he said he was

Why are you a Christian? (Which "why" question?)

  * philosophical
  * autobiographical
  * what it means to me
