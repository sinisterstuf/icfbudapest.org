On one of the Fridays, we gathered at Eszter and Febi's place for a special autumn event:)

Everyone dressed up in autumn colors and we brought some pumpkin flavored food:) it was a lot of fun and quite many of us came together to a small but cosy place.

We did have some time for worship, a shorter Bible study as well (from Acts) and there were some very interesting questions relating to the topic, which stirred the conversation since there were people present from outside of ICFB group as well.

Some of us stayed until midnight to chat, play some music... it was a meaningful and nice evening.

Happy Autumn!
